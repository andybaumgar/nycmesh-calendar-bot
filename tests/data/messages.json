(<https://coneyisland.makerfaire.com/|main website link>)\n\nWe've been approved to set up a table at the faire happening October 6th to 8th in Coney Island to talk to people about the mesh.\nWe will need people to help out and take shifts at the table over the weekend. (Rotating so not everyone is there the whole time)\n\nI've got confirmation that 6 people will be able to get free passes for the faire. I'll give these to myself and the 5 people who are at the table the most over the weekend. Other volunteers may need to buy tickets, though I have been told I can request additional passes so I might be able to get more.\n\nThread in <#C02UK9Z8W> (<https://nycmesh.slack.com/archives/C02UK9Z8W/p1693536918586919|link>), please reply in the thread if you are interested in helping out.\nThere is also a Google Sheet schedule to claim table shifts. First come-first served, but if a lot of people are interested I might try to move things around a bit and give everyone a chance to help out. (There are 2 people + me per shift due to limited space at the table)\n\nAlso unrelated to the mesh table, the faire is also looking for people to do marketing leading up to the event in exchange for free tickets. Either putting up posters or 3d printing marketing materials. Info for that: <https://coneyisland.makerfaire.com/streetteam/> <https://coneyisland.makerfaire.com/3dteam/>",
